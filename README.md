Hi.. I created an app fitness 
1. *Health Tracking* – Tracks steps, calories, workouts, and sleep to monitor daily fitness.

2. *Personal Goals* – Allows users to set goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or staying active.

3. *Reminders & Alerts* – Sends notifications for water intake, workout time, or breaks.

4. *Progress Reports* – Shows weekly/monthly stats to track improvement.

5. *User Friendly* – Simple interface so users of all ages can easily use and follow routines.
